# Challenge 6: Weather Dashboard

The goal of this challenge was to create a weather dashboard that displays both the current weather and a 5-day forecast for a given city. It should also have a list of previous searches that the user can click to bring up the weather display for that city.

On page load, the user should see a search bar and buttons for previous searches. Upon either entering a city name or clicking one of the history buttons, the weather API should be called and the results should be displayed to the screen. The next time the page is loaded or the next time a search is performed, the history buttons should be updated with the most recent search at the top of the list. 
Both the current weather and forecast displays should show the temperature, wind speed, and humidity. The current weather display should also display a color-code UV index for that day(green, yellow, or red).
